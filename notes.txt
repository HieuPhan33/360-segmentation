Done tasks
    1. Compute class distribution.
    2. Evaluate PASS on Footpath data.

Issues:
    1. Data preparation instruction is unclear: Mapillary in paper,
    but Cityscapes in the code.

To do tasks:
    1. Prepare Footpath data folder for PASSS.
    2. Train PASS on Footpath data.
    3. Train Deeplab-v3+ or HRNet (regular image segmentation) -> concat prediction.
    Test: Predict separately two parts of the pano.

2 Baselines: PASS and regular image segmentation approaches.

Apply augmentation (not specifically target pano distortion):
1) Increase images.
2) To make predictions more robust to visual changing.
